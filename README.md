# AIC_POAT - Research Project Repository

This repository contains the code and documentation for the research project conducted at the University of Aveiro, Portugal. The project focuses on the evaluation of territorial impact from urban revitalization operations.

Please clone the repository in order to download the below structure of folders and files.

## Project Structure

The repository encompasses 2 approaches to perform the evaluation of territorial impact from urban revitalizaion operations, divided in 2 folders:
- Approach 1 Folder (using Difference-in-Differences methodology)
- Approach 2 Folder (preferences evaluation for residence location)

### The Approach_1 Folder is organized as follows:
